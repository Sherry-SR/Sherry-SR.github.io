The motivation of this work was to determine the best device position within limited X-ray shots in order to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure administered by the system. My work involved investigating different design markers by which to encode the device pose, and I decoding the pose through segmentation and registration methods. In addition, I developed an end-to-end learning scheme to train a deep neural network based on the whole image information, using tens of thousands synthetic X-ray data I generated. Also, I applied homoscedasticity uncertainty in the neural network to estimate the error balancing ratio in order to reduce hyperparameter tuning.\n","permalink":"https://sherry-sr.github.io/projects/pose/","tags":["Python","Tensorflow","OpenCV","Registration","Mobile C-arm","X-ray","PoseNet","Homoscedasticity Uncertainty"],"title":"Mobile C-arm Pose Estimation"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Practicing handwriting using the copybook of calligraphy is suffering because we usually don\u0026rsquo;t know how good we write and how much we can improve it. So we developed Master Writing to help people conquer it. Master Writing is an IOS application that helps people improve handwriting by showing how a master is writing and let people imitate it. Users can learn how to master different fonts by practicing writing letters, words and sentences. The strokes, force and angel are recorded when users are writing. These information are compared with a master\u0026rsquo;s, and various feedbacks are provided interactively at the same time to tell people how to improve. This app was developed by me and two friends within 36 hours during Hophacks 2018 spring.\n","permalink":"https://sherry-sr.github.io/projects/write/","tags":["Swift","Apple Pencil","Apple APIs","Python","OpenCV","IOS","Segmentation","UI Design","Real-time Feedback"],"title":"Master Writing IOS App"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This is my course project for Wavelets course.

This technique uses two physiological measures, specifically arterial CO2 and O2 time course, as input and BOLD MRI signal time course as output, and employs a linear model to determine the association between gas challenge and MRI signal, which is related to vascular properties of the brain. A prerequisite of this analysis is that the CO2 and O2 time course needs to be aligned temporally. However, in practice, the CO2 and O2 recordings are obtained from different instruments thus they are not always properly aligned. In this project, I developed a simple and fully automated method to synchronize the CO2 and O2 signals, based on time-shifted correlation of these two signals. The proposed algorithm may be a useful tool in pre-processing of gas-inhalation MRI data.\n","permalink":"https://sherry-sr.github.io/projects/ivas/","tags":["iVas MRI","Signal Synchronization","Matlab"],"title":"Integrated vascular (iVas) MRI"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://sherry-sr.github.io/publications/foetalismrm2017/","tags":null,"title":"A pilot study of lateral ventricle volume from in utero foetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://sherry-sr.github.io/publications/gridradiology2018/","tags":null,"title":"Design and Application of fMRI Paradigm referred to Spatial navigation Based on Grid Cell Symmetry"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This is my bachelor graduation project in 2016. Inspired by the paper \u0026ldquo;Grid-cell representations in mental simulation\u0026rdquo; published in August 2016, I was thinking if grid-like representations can be activated given more abstract and simple cues, and can be detected using fMRI. The motivation was to simplify the original experimental paradigm from the paper, in order to make it possible to use in wider clinical trails and measurements. In my graduation project, I first implemented the navigation task in virtual-reality city using Unity3D. By analyzing fMRI signals of subjects conducting the task, we observed the sinusoidal signals as a function of moving direction successfully, which confirmed the recent published discovery of grid cell firing pattern. Then I designed a modified paradigm using PyQt based on my assumption, which only kept the location relationship in previous task and represented them in 2D plane, without other 3D visual cues. we collected fMRI data of 10 subjects and conducted the same analyzation using DPABI and SPM, among which 9 subjects had positive activation. I was awarded Outstanding Graduation Project in June 2017.\n","permalink":"https://sherry-sr.github.io/projects/grid/","tags":["Grid Cell","fMRI","Raradigm Design","Unity3D","Python","PyQt","Matlab","SPM","DPABI"],"title":"Paradigm Design for Grid Cell Study"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This project was to investigate super resolution reconstruction of lateral ventricle volume from fetal brain MRI data. The most challenging aspect of the project was to deal with the inter-slice noise caused by fetal head motion. We implemented a reconstruction method in my co-authored paper published in ISMRM, where we first modeled degradation and realigned low-resolution images via convex optimization in order to reduce motion artifacts. This result along with additional data from the same gestation week was used in a sparse reconstruction algorithm to achieve the desired super-resolution.\n","permalink":"https://sherry-sr.github.io/projects/fetal/","tags":["Fetal Brain MRI","Sparse Reconstruction","Super Resolution","Optimization"],"title":"Fetal Brain Reconstruction from MRI"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This is a small prject I have been working on when I first joined Medical Electronics Laboratory in Southeast University.
